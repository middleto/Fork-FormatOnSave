This directory contains the source text of EPIC User's Guide in the
DocBook format. The accompanying Ant build.xml script can be used to
produce the final output.

The XML source may be edited either as plain (XML) text or with
an appropriate editor. The former approach is cumbersome and error-prone
due to DocBook's verbosity. The latter option is preferable, for which
I recommend the XXE editor (cross-platform and very nice). It can be
obtained for free from http://www.xmlmind.com/xmleditor/

Whichever option you choose, it helps to know the basic DocBook syntax,
which can be found in the Definitive Guide by Norman Walsh (also available
online; based on my experience, you don't have to read the whole book
to become productive).
