This catalog had unfortunately to be created manually to satisfy
the references from DocBook's chunker.xsl under Debian (otherwise
the XSLT processor kept downloading the DTD from the Web).

Not only that, but I had to create a bunch of symlinks in
/usr/share/xml/xhtml/schema/dtd/1.0, otherwise the *.ent wouldn't
be found. This necessity has been once reported as a bug already:
http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=423087

xhtml-lat1.ent -> /usr/share/xml/entities/xhtml/xhtml-lat1.ent
xhtml-special.ent -> /usr/share/xml/entities/xhtml/xhtml-special.ent
xhtml-symbol.ent -> /usr/share/xml/entities/xhtml/xhtml-symbol.ent
