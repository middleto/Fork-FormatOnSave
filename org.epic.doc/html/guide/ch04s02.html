    <p>Views support editors and provide alternative presentations as well as ways to navigate the
    information in your Workbench. For example, the Navigator view displays projects and other
    resources that you are working with.</p>

    <p>Views also have their own menus. To open the menu for a view, click the icon at the left end
    of the view's title bar. Some views also have their own toolbars. The actions represented by
    buttons on view toolbars only affect the items within that view.</p>

    <p>A view might appear by itself, or stacked with other views in a tabbed notebook. You can
    change the layout of a perspective by opening and closing views and by docking them in
    different positions in the Workbench window.</p>
